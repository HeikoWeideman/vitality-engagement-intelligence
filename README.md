# Vitality Engagement Intelligence Engine

An end-to-end machine-learning product for predicting near-term wellness-programme disengagement, selecting an appropriate behavioural intervention, and generating a safe personalised message.

## Current status

Stages 1–5 are complete. The latest completed milestone is **Stage 5 — Governed activation workflow**, which adds deterministic, capacity-aware activation decisions, verified local artifacts, a human-review queue, lineage controls, and fail-closed safety boundaries.

Stage 6 — Looker Studio dashboard is the next planned stage.

### Project delivery status

| Stage                                                | Status      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Stage 1 — Repository and development foundation      | Complete    |
| Stage 2 — Synthetic data and BigQuery ingestion      | Complete    |
| Stage 3 — Governed features and BigQuery ML baseline | Complete    |
| Stage 4 — Python modelling and operational scoring   | Complete    |
| Stage 5 — Activation pipeline                        | Complete    |
| Stage 6 — Looker Studio dashboard                    | Not started |
| Stage 7 — Monitoring and governance                  | Not started |
| Stage 8 — Final documentation and portfolio polish   | Not started |

All modelling results use synthetic data and must not be interpreted as evidence about real member behaviour, health, eligibility, or intervention effectiveness.

## Stage 5 — Governed activation workflow

Stage 5 converts verified scoring forecasts and an independently verified contact-context snapshot into deterministic, capacity-aware recommendations for mandatory human review.

The workflow audits every scoring row, applies permission and suppression rules, preserves scoring and contact-context lineage, enforces a maximum of 100 selected records per run, and writes verified local Parquet and metadata artifacts.

A legitimate approved contact-context artifact is required. The repository does not fabricate or provide one.

The local command is available through:

`python -m vitality_engagement.activation.cli`

Do not run it until approved contact-context files exist. The default local outputs are:

- `artifacts/activation/activation_decisions.parquet`
- `artifacts/activation/activation_decisions.metadata.json`
- `artifacts/activation/human_review_queue.parquet`
- `artifacts/activation/human_review_queue.metadata.json`

The human-review queue contains only records already marked `selected_for_review`, ordered by deterministic priority rank, with a fixed `pending_human_review` status. Its metadata preserves SHA-256 lineage to both source activation artifacts.

The CLI prints the activation artifact paths, review-queue paths, source rows audited, selected count, and `Mode: local artifacts only`.

A selected record is a recommendation for authorised human review only. It is not automatically approved for contact.

See `docs/activation_policy.md` and `docs/activation_runbook.md`.

## Stage 4 — Python modelling

Stage 4 implements a leakage-safe Python modelling workflow on top of the governed BigQuery feature layer.

### Modelling dataset

The feature export contains:

| Item                    |  Value |
| ----------------------- | -----: |
| Total rows              | 76,000 |
| Synthetic members       |    500 |
| Approved predictors     |     47 |
| Categorical predictors  |      3 |
| Numeric predictors      |     44 |
| Train rows              | 46,000 |
| Validation rows         | 15,500 |
| Test rows               | 11,000 |
| Unlabelled scoring rows |  3,500 |

The data is split chronologically rather than randomly. Member identifiers, prediction dates, targets, split labels, and prohibited future-derived fields are excluded from the predictor matrix.

### Selected model

The selected Python model is a regularised logistic-regression pipeline with:

* Most-frequent categorical imputation
* One-hot categorical encoding
* Median numeric imputation
* Numeric standardisation
* Logistic regression using `C=1.0`
* `lbfgs` solver
* Maximum 1,000 iterations
* Random state `42`

The decision threshold was selected on validation data only by maximising positive-class F1. The frozen threshold is:

```text
0.431
```

### Validation model comparison

| Metric                     | Logistic regression | Histogram gradient boosting |
| -------------------------- | ------------------: | --------------------------: |
| ROC-AUC                    |              0.9476 |                      0.9404 |
| PR-AUC                     |              0.8705 |                      0.8508 |
| Log loss                   |              0.2377 |                      0.2549 |
| Brier score                |              0.0733 |                      0.0792 |
| Positive-class F1          |              0.7721 |                      0.7499 |
| Top-decile lift            |              4.1395 |                      4.0620 |
| Expected calibration error |              0.0136 |                      0.0172 |

The nonlinear candidate did not improve validation performance enough to justify its additional complexity. Logistic regression therefore remains the frozen Stage 4 model.

### Frozen logistic test audit

| Metric                     | Result |
| -------------------------- | -----: |
| ROC-AUC                    | 0.9565 |
| PR-AUC                     | 0.9114 |
| Log loss                   | 0.2259 |
| Brier score                | 0.0690 |
| Precision                  | 0.8400 |
| Recall                     | 0.7920 |
| Positive-class F1          | 0.8153 |
| Specificity                | 0.9444 |
| Accuracy                   | 0.9034 |
| Top-decile lift            | 3.6833 |
| Expected calibration error | 0.0095 |

The logistic specification and threshold were frozen before this test evaluation. However, the test result had already been viewed before nonlinear-model development began. It is therefore a valid frozen-logistic audit, but not a completely untouched cross-model holdout for all Stage 4 experimentation.

The nonlinear candidate was developed and rejected using train and validation data only and was not evaluated on the test split.

### Export the governed modelling dataset

```powershell
python -m vitality_engagement.models.export_features
```

The default output is:

```text
data/modeling/engagement_modeling_split.parquet
```

### Persist the selected model

```powershell
python -c "from vitality_engagement.models.load_data import load_chronological_modeling_data; from vitality_engagement.models.persistence import save_selected_model; save_selected_model(load_chronological_modeling_data())"
```

The local ignored artifacts are:

```text
models/python_logistic_baseline.pkl
models/python_logistic_baseline.metadata.json
```

Only trusted model artifacts created by this project should be loaded. Pickle artifacts can execute code during deserialisation.

### Generate operational predictions

```powershell
python -m vitality_engagement.models.scoring_artifact
```

The command scores the 3,500 unlabelled operational rows and creates:

```text
artifacts/scoring/python_logistic_scoring_predictions.parquet
artifacts/scoring/python_logistic_scoring_predictions.metadata.json
```

The prediction output contains:

| Column             | Meaning                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `member_id`        | Synthetic member identifier             |
| `prediction_date`  | Prediction date                         |
| `risk_probability` | Estimated positive-class probability    |
| `is_high_risk`     | Whether probability is at least `0.431` |
| `model_name`       | Frozen model name                       |
| `threshold`        | Frozen threshold                        |

These rows are forecasts, not confirmed missed-goal outcomes.
